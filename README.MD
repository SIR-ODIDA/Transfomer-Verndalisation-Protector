PROJECT SET UP
Transformer vandalism is a menace that has seen the Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) losing billions of money replacing the transformers.
 This has resulted to many people and companies to suffer due to lack of electricity as a result of stolen transformers or oil siphoning. 
Transformers comprise of two main expensive materials which people are always looking for. One is copper which is used for the windings and the second is the oil used for cooling the transformers. 
When transformer cooling oil is drained, the cooling effect is lowered leading to breakdown of the transformer hence making people within a certain transformer coordinate have power blackout until the transformer is being replaced.


PROBLEM STATEMENT
Transformer vandalism is becoming an alarming issue in the whole world. Power distribution companies are incurring losses of billions of money due to transformer vandalism. We are going to design a monitoring system that can be able to detect the presence of a vandal near the transformer, raise the alarm and send a message/call the control room officers or security officers in designated areas for response. 
The project is going to have an algorithm that will be able to show the transformer location, transformer number and the necessary authorities near the transformer. The monitoring system will be a combination of Arduino hardware with Integrated Development Environment (IDE) program, sensors, relay and GSM for mobile communications. 

In this project ,  the case study will be Kenya Power Company, a state utility company that is responsible for distributing electricity to consumers, emergency electricity services and lastly retails the electricity in Kenya.
The Project will also be able to curb related problems related to  the transformer for example being in a position of alarming when tackled by an intruder thereby making the residents around the spefic locality be aware of what is happening to the public transformer.
Having body temperature sensors that are very sensible to human temperatures only hence assuming temperatures for the aves(birds). This will help the control room of the Kenya power to only get alerted whenever humans tamper with the transformer thereby avoiding rampant calls and messages that might be unnecessary.
Also interfacing the transformer sensors with the phase voltages and currents. This will be very paramount because it will help the the Kenya power staffs to get to know whenever a certain phase has no power ,where exactly and the reason behind the problem. This absolutely promotes power reliability and dependability among the Kenya Power customers who keep on yawning for assistance whenever power is rationed.
Alternatively the use of Kenya Power simcards gives an input of incredible production and enhances profits to the company. This is achieved by being dependant to themselves rather than other expensive network telecommunications that sometimes are not reliable to it's clients.
Application of special wiremesh as casing has also turned out to be crucial . Since they are readily available materials that can be found anywhere within the country just like the metal sheet being used. Materials are affordable to the project.

Use of Rf (Radio frequency). This is also another geared means of communication via the frequency signals by receiving and sending the signals to the designated platforms or  areas.
Use the the Rf is absolutely superb but it gets some small complications of temperature and environmental conditions leading to misinterpreting of the signal beng sent and received.
Interpolating the prototype with the current transformers. This will enhance the workability of power and will highly avoid instantaneous power shortages in some designated areas experiencing loss of power without the knowledge of the relevance of Kenya power.
Use of high wattage lighting system(bulb) to automatically 


UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND TARGET
To prevent transformer from being stolen by the vandals.  Achieved through availability of sensors that will detect the intruder from far meters away
To detect internal faults in the transformer with a high degree of sensitivity and cause subsequent de –energization  
To curb the loss of transformer oil from transformers that vandals take and vandals take and use for their commercial purposes.
To enhance efficiency and reliability of transformers all over the coordinates by provision of limit switch and relays that release out shock to the transformer casing.
To offer 24/7 security monitoring system regardless of the weather conditions and locations
To protect electrical transformers to ensure continuous supply of electricity to customers

ARCHITECTURE
           Many people have lost their lives due to the electrocution. The most affected equipments are transformers because they contain oil and copper material that have high demand in the black market. 
Vandalism exposes customers to dangers of electricity shortage and waiting to be replaced or repaired,
The uses of transformers locally involves sold as fuel in rural areas, used as industrial furnaces in industries and welding sets and also also used as a cosmetic and treatment of wounds.
Due to these demands transformers are at high risk of being vandalized anytime. Mostly happens cities such as Nairobi, Kisumu, Mombasa, MERU and KIAMBU where the there are many slum areas embarked with transformers.
Power vandalism is one of the economic sabotage done by well-organized syndicate that works in major town in the country.
ITERATION/FEEDBACK/TESTING
The construction of transformer vandalization protector has basically been an idea that is going to be true since the menace is absolutely affecting the needs of many people.
Construction started at the electrical workshop where everything is being done accordingly. It starts with simple construction of block diagrams, wiring diagrams and assembling of materials required.
Materials named above were basically used in the construction. The progress of project basically depends on the program and coding feeded.
It all begins by connecting the relay,GSM, Ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino board.This enhances communication between the components allowing the relay to release electrical shock to the transformer casing.
